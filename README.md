Crest Solution for Elevator and Air reservation System
Elevator Problem: 

I have used C++ as the programming language to design it. The respository "CresSolution" contains a file by name "elevator.cpp". We can directly run this file in any editor which supports C++. If there is any error while running the code kindly use an online editor and check. 

Assumptions: 
1.)Any number of persons can enter the lift (dynamic).
2.)Enter the weights and floors to which they need to be dropped off.
3.)Total number of stops taken will be retrieved. I have consider lift initially in second floor should travel to lobby for persons to enter, hence this is one stop and also after dropping off all people it should again come down to ground floor and this is considered as second stop. So total number of stops for dropping of people will be sum of stops taken + 2.

Airline Reservations: 

I have used Java as the programming language to design the system. The repository "CrestSolution" contains a src folder which has the package. Download the folder(zip) and import it in Eclipse IDE. Kindly let me know if this does not work. 

Assumptions: 
1.)Enter the reserved string in format(1A 2B 3C) and we can give any number of reserved seats(dynamic).

We get the maximum number of seats that are available for a family of 3 people to be booked.
